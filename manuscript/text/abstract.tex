In this work, we detail the construction of block-encodings for observables described as a linear combination of products of ladder operators acting on fermionic, antifermionic, and bosonic modes.
We refer to this constuction as LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding) and show how it can be used to simulate Hamiltonians involving interactions between these different types of particles.
Our work builds off of similar sparse block-encoding constructions for fermionic system, but generalizes them to include bosonic ladder operators.
Additionally, we establish a clear connection between these sparse block-encodings and LCU (Linear Combination of Unitaries) block-encodings.
This connection allows for implementations of these block-encodings that significantly reduce the rescaling factor of the block-encoding without significantly affecting the quantum resources required to implement the block-encoding.
Constructing efficient block-encodings that allow for interactions between fermions, antifermions, and bosons, paves the way for the simulation of systems that are not purely fermionic which is vital for the simulation of many models that arise in high-energy physics.
