In this work, we describe and analyze a framework for block-encoding operators described by second-quantized ladder operators that act upon fermionic and bosonic modes.
We refer to this framework as LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding) and show how it can be used to reduce the spacetime quantum resources required to block-encode Hamiltonians of various systems.
Specifically, we compare LOBE to techniques which require expanding the ladder operators in the Pauli basis and we numerically benchmark these constructions using various models arising in quantum field theories including $\phi^4$ and the full Yukawa model.
The numerical quantum resource estimates presented in this work show that LOBE produces block-encodings with fewer non-Clifford operations, fewer block-encoding ancillae and overall number of qubits, and lower rescaling factors for many different classes of operators and Hamiltonians.
Additionally, the LOBE constructions have better asymptotic scaling with respect to several key paramters including the maximum occupation of bosonic modes, \ws{the resolution}, and the locality of the operators.
