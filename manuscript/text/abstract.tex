In this work, we detail the construction of block-encodings for observables described as a linear combination of products of ladder operators acting on fermionic, antifermionic, and bosonic modes.
We refer to this constuction as LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding) and show how it can be used to simulate Hamiltonians involving interactions between these different types of particles.
Our work builds off of similar sparse-oracle constructions for fermionic system, but generalizes them to include bosonic ladder operators.
Additionally, we establish a clear connection between these sparse block-encodings and block-encodings refered to as LCU (Linear Combination of Unitaries).
To our knowledge, this is the first block-encoding construction that allows for interactions between fermions, antifermions, and bosons, paving the way for simulation of more complicated quantum systems such as those that arise in high-energy physics.
