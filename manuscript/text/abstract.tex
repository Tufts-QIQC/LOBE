In this work, we detail the construction of quantum circuit oracles that create block-encodings for observables described as a linear combination of products of ladder operators acting on fermionic, antifermionic, and bosonic modes.
We refer to this constuction as LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding) and show how it can be used to simulate Hamiltonians involving interactions between these different types of particles.
Our work builds off of similar sparse-oracle constructions in the literature, but generalizes prior works to establish a clear connection with block-encoding methods that are commonly refered to as LCU (Linear Combination of Unitaries).
In addition to extnding LCU to more general observables that are given as a Linear combination of products of ladder operators, we also demonstrate how these oracles can be extended to include bosonic ladder operators.
To our knowledge, this is the first block-encoding construction that allows for interactions between fermions, antifermions, and bosons, paving the way for simulation of more complicated quantum systems such as those that arise in high-energy physics.
