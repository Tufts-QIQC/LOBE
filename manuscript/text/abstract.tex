In this work, we describe and analyze a framework for block-encoding second-quantized ladder operators which act upon fermionic and bosonic modes.
We refer to this framework as LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding) and show that it can be used to reduce the spacetime quantum resources required to block-encode various second-quantized operators.
Specifically, we compare LOBE to block-encoding frameworks which require expanding the operators in the Pauli basis.
We numerically benchmark these constructions using models arising in quantum field theories including $\phi^4$ theory and the full Yukawa model.
The numerical quantum resource estimates presented in this work show that LOBE produces block-encodings with fewer non-Clifford operations, fewer block-encoding ancillae and overall number of qubits, and lower rescaling factors for various second-quantized operators.
The LOBE constructions demonstrate favorable scaling with respect to several key paramters including the maximum occupation of bosonic modes, the total number of fermionic and bosonic modes, and the locality of the operators.
