\subsection{Full Yukawa Results}
\label{sec:yukawa_results}

The first interacting field theory between different types of particles studied is generally the Yukawa model.
This is a theory of interacting fermions and bosons which can be used as a model of the strong nuclear force between hadrons.
The Lagrangian for this model is given as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:yukawa-lagrangian}
    \mathcal{L} = \bar \psi \left(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m \right)\psi + \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi - \frac{1}{2}\mu^2\phi^2 - g\bar \psi \psi \phi,
\end{equation}
