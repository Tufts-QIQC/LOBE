\subsection{Quartic Harmonic Oscillator Results}
\label{sec:qosc_results}

The quartic harmonic oscillator \cite{PhysRev.184.1231, girguś2024spiralflowquantumquartic, wójcik2012applicationnumericalrenormalizationgroup} is an extension of the standard harmonic oscillator with an additional non-linearity of the form $g \varphi^4$, where $g$ is an arbitrary constant that dictates the strength of the interaction, and $\phi$ is a bosonic field.
This leads to the Hamiltonian $H = \frac12\dot\phi^2 + \frac{m}{2}\phi^2 + gm^3\phi^4 $, where $\phi$ is composed of a single mode.
$m$ is the mass of the bosonic particle, and $\dot \phi$ represents the time derivate of the field.

In a second-quantized, dimensionless form, the Hamiltonian can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:qosc}
    H = a^\dagger a + g\left(a + a^\dagger \right)^4
\end{equation}
where there is only one bosonic mode.

After expanding the product, normal ordering all terms, and removing the constant offset, this Hamiltonian can be written as a linear combination of $8$ terms consisting of three pairs of operators plus their hermitian conjugates and two operators that are their own hermitian conjugates:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        H = &(12g + 1) a^\dagger a + 6g a^{\dagger^2} a^2 + 6g \left(a^{\dagger^2} + a^2 \right) \\
        + &4g \left(a^{\dagger^3} a + a^\dagger a^3 \right) + g \left(a^{\dagger^4} + a^4 \right)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

In Figure \ref{fig:qosc}, we show the scaling of the spacetime costs associated with both the LOBE and Pauli Expansion block-encodings as a function of the bosonic occupation cutoff ($\Omega$).
For small values of $\Omega$, the Pauli Expansion block-encodings result in lower spacetime costs, however, the LOBE constructions have favorable scaling and therefore a crossover point is seen.
For the time-complexity, this crossover occurs at $\Omega = 15$ for the number of T gates and $\Omega = 7$ for the number of non-Clifford rotations.
For the space-complexity, this crossover occurs at $\Omega = 7$ for the number of block-encoding ancillae and $\Omega = 31$ for the maximum number of qubits.
Finally, for the rescaling factor, this crossover occurs at $\Omega = 31$.
