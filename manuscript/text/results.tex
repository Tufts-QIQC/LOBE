\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, we demonstrate the use of LOBE to block-encode Hamiltonians derived from quantum field theories: Yukawa theory and $\phi^4$ theory \cite{Peskin:1995ev}.
We study both variants of the block-encoding described in Sections \ref{sec:block-encoding} and expanded upon in Section \ref{sec:lobe} and give numerical counts for the numbers of non-Clifford operations, the number of ancillae required beyond the system register, and the rescaling factor imposed on the resulting block-encoding.

The results that we present here are generated based on constructions of LOBE that are written in Cirq \cite{cirq} and the block-encodings are numerically verified for circuits of up to 14 qubits.
Additionally, the operators are constructed through the use of OpenParticle \cite{openparticle}, a software library for the construction and manipulation of fermionic, antifermionic, and bosonic ladder operators.
The software library \cite{grover-rudolph-github} is used to determine the rotation angles required for Grover-Rudolph.

\subsection{Yukawa Theory}
A quantum field theory that models the strong nuclear force between hadrons is Yukawa theory \cite{Peskin:1995ev}. In this theory, hadrons are described by a fermionic field $\psi$, coupled via a scalar boson $\phi$. The interaction term is $\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = g\bar\psi \psi \phi$, which leads to interaction vertices containing fermions and/or antifermions and bosons. The Lagrangian, and thus the Hamiltonian, is written as a sum of free, non-ineteracting fields and the interaction term.

Utilizing the lightfront frame \cite{Dirac1949}, leads to a straightforward approach to writing down the Hamiltonian bound-state eigenvalue equation in terms of ladder operators. This lightfront frame removes the ambiguous $\sqrt{\nabla^2 + m^2}$ term that appears in a canonical, instant-time frame Hamiltonian approach. 

The interaction terms in the Hamiltonian are $H_{\text{Yukawa int}} \in \{b^\dagger b a, b^\dagger b a^\dagger, d^\dagger d a, d^\dagger d a^\dagger, b^\dagger d^\dagger a, bda^\dagger, b^\dagger b a^\dagger a, d^\dagger d a^\dagger a \}$, while the free part of the Hamiltonian is $H_{\text{free}} \in \{b^\dagger b, d^\dagger d, a^\dagger a \}$. 
Much of the interesting physics arises from the interacting piece. The terms $b^\dagger b a$ and $b^\dagger b a^\dagger$ describe the annihilation of a fermion with a boson and creation of a fermion, and the creation of a fermion-boson pair from a fermion respectively. $d^\dagger d a$ and $d^\dagger d a^\dagger$ describe the same interactions but for antifermions and bosons. 
$b^\dagger d^\dagger a$ and $bda^\dagger$ correspond to fermion-antifermion pair creation and annihilation, and lastly, $b^\dagger b a^\dagger a$ and $d^\dagger d a^\dagger a$ are terms of $\mathcal{O}(g^2)$, unique to the lighfront frame.

This Hamiltonian can be written out as a discrete sum over these free and interaction ladder operators with coefficients coming from lightfront coordinates. The Hamiltonian can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Yukawa-hamiltonian}
    H_{\text{Yukawa}} = H_0 + H_{\bar\psi \psi \phi}.
\end{equation}
The explicit form of the Hamiltonian will be written out in the appendix \ref{subsec:lightfront-hamiltonian}.

In Figure \ref{fig:Yukawa_hamiltonian_gates_vs_terms}, we plot the numerical gate counts estimates for the Yukawa Hamiltonian (Eq. \ref{eq:Yukawa-hamiltonian}) as the number of terms in the Hamiltonain ($L$) increases.
The number of terms ($L$) increases directly with an increasing number of momentum modes as $\mathcal{O}(I^3)$.
For the three non-Clifford operations, the number of operations increases linearly with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian for this model.
Additionally, the two different compilation strategies (\textit{USP} (blue), \textit{ASP} (orange)) demonstrate the same numerical scaling and have nearly identical gate counts for all types of operations.
When the number of terms ($L$) is far from the next largest power of 2, \textit{ASP} requires more arbitrary rotations due to the compilation of Grover-Rudolph and multiplexed rotations that is used in this work.

In Figure \ref{fig:Yukawa_hamiltonian_qubits_and_rescaling_vs_terms}, we plot the numerical estimates for the number of required ancillae (left) and the imposed rescaling factor (right) as the number of terms in the Hamiltonain ($L$) increases.
The number of ancillae grows logarithmically with the number of terms for both implementations.
The number of ancillae used for the index register grows logarithmically with the number of terms which accounts for this scaling.
The main advantage of the \textit{ASP} variant is the effect on the rescaling factor of the block-encoding.
While the rescaling factor of both variants seemingly grows linearly with respect to the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, the rescaling factor for the \textit{ASP} variant is significantly smaller than the \textit{USP} variant.
When block-encodings are employed as a subroutine in larger algorithms, the quantum resources for the algorithm are often dependent on the rescaling factor (with a lower rescaling factor generally being preferred).
For example, in the context of using Quantum Phase Estimation to estimate the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian, the number of gates required typically scales as $O(\frac{1}{\lambda})$ \cite{babbush2018encoding}. 
However, the exact cost associated with the rescaling factor is difficult to determine without choosing a specific algorithm to benchmark with.

In Figure \ref{fig:Yukawa_hamiltonian_gates_vs_omega}, we plot the numerical gate counts estimates for the Yukawa Hamiltonian (Eq. \ref{eq:Yukawa-hamiltonian}) as the cutoff on the maximum bosonic occupation ($\Omega$) increases.
For the three non-Clifford operations, the number of operations increases linearly with the bosonic occupancy cutoff for this model.
Similar to the case with increasing $I$, the two different compilation strategies (\textit{USP} (blue), \textit{ASP} orange) demonstrate the same numerical scaling and have nearly identical gate counts for all types of operations.

In Figure \ref{fig:Yukawa_hamiltonian_qubits_and_rescaling_vs_omega}, we plot the numerical estimates for the number of required ancillae (left) and the imposed rescaling factor (right) as the cutoff on the maximum bosonic occupation ($\Omega$) increases.
The number of ancillae grows logarithmically with the bosonic occupation cutoff for both implementations.
The number of ancillae needed to update the bosonic occupancy grows logarithmically with $\Omega$ (Eq. \ref{eq:ancillae-bosonic-updates}) which accounts for this scaling.
Again, the main advantage of the \textit{ASP} variant is that the imposed rescaling factor is significantly smaller than the \textit{USP} variant, especially for large values of $\Omega$ despite the asymptotic scaling being linear for both.

It is important to note about the rescaling factor ($\lambda$) with the occupation cutoff ($\Omega$). For both \textit{USP} and \textit{ASP}, the rescaling factors depend on $\lambda_A$ \ref{eq:bosonic-rescaling-factor}, which is proportional to $\Omega^{A/2}$. 
For Yukawa theory, $A$, is fixed to 2 (this comes from the free piece $\sim a^\dagger a$). Thus, $(\Omega + 1)^{A/2}$ gives linear scaling. 


\subsection{$\phi^4$ Theory}
Another interesting field theoretical application of LOBE comes from a purely bosonic theory: $\phi^4$. This model describes a self-interacting bosonic field with $\mathcal{L}_{int} = g\phi^4$. 
There are three main interaction first order vertices in this theory: 2 bosons $\rightarrow$ 2 bosons: $a^\dagger a^\dagger a a$, 1 boson $\rightarrow$ 3 bosons: $a^\dagger a^\dagger a^\dagger a$, and 3 bosons $\rightarrow$ 1 boson: $a^\dagger a a a$. 
The explicit form of the Hamiltonian is given in appendix \ref{subsec:lightfront-hamiltonian}.

Figures \ref{fig:phi4_hamiltonian_gates_vs_terms} and \ref{fig:phi4_hamiltonian_qubits_and_rescaling_vs_terms} show the scaling of gates and qubits needed to simulate the $\phi^4$ Hamiltonian with LOBE as the number of terms in the Hamiltonian ($L$) increases. 
In the same way as the Yukawa Hamiltonian, the number of terms ($L$) increases directly with an increasing number of momentum modes as $\mathcal{O}(I^3)$. The scaling for the two different compilation strategies (\textit{USP} (blue), \textit{ASP} (orange)) demonstrate the same numerical scaling and have nearly identical gate counts for all types of operations. 

Figures \ref{fig:phi4_hamiltonian_gates_vs_omega} and \ref{fig:phi4_hamiltonian_qubits_and_rescaling_vs_omega} show the scaling of gates and qubits needed to simulate the $\phi^4$ Hamiltonian with LOBE as the maximum bosonic occupancy ($\Omega$) increases. Similar to the case with increasing \textit{I}, the scaling for the two different compilation strategies (\textit{USP} (blue), \textit{ASP} (orange)) demonstrate the same numerical scaling and have nearly identical gate counts for all types of operations. 

Again, the scaling of $\lambda$ with $\Omega$ must be mentioned. For $\phi^4$-theory, $A = 4$, (this comes from the interaction piece), so the scaling of $\lambda$ is $\sim \Omega^2$, which gives quadratic scaling for both \textit{USP} and \textit{ASP}.
