\section{Results / Numerical Benchmarking}
\label{sec:results}

here we'll "benchmark" (aka numerically compute the cost - number of qubits and gates - of creating a lobe block-encoding) for some systems

ideas of systems to benchmark on:

- Fermi-Hubbard 

- Something with just bosons

- Something with fermions, antifermions, and bosons
