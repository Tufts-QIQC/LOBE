%Give background of ladder operators and constructions of realistic Hamiltonians/Observables from ladder Operators
In quantum field theories and quantum chemistry, the main method of keeping track of multiparticle states is known as second quantization \cite{Sakurai_Napolitano_2020}.
In second quantization, multiparticle state vectors are written as $\ket{n} = \ket{n_{I-1}, \dots, n_1, n_0}$ where $n_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ is the number of particles present in mode $i$.
The fermionic (and antifermionic) occupancy of a mode can either be $0$ or $1$ due to the Pauli exclusion principle \gus{cite PEP}.

There is no physical limitation on the occupancy of bosonic modes: $n_{i_a} \in [0, 1, 2, \dots)$.
This leads to an infinitely large space, therefore we can impose an artificial occupancy cutoff ($\Omega$) such that $n_{i_a} \in [0, 1, 2, \Omega)$ and the space becomes finite.
The cutoff on the occupancy can introduce error as some physically allowable states become inaccessible.
However, $\Omega$ can often be chosen such that this error is either zero (if high-occupancy states are never accessed) or reasonable small and the contribution of the magnitude of the error is known. 
\ws{@Kamil/@Gus, is this a fair statement? Is there something we can cite for either no-error or known-error cases?}

The space spanned by the second-quantized state vectors is called the \textit{Fock space} ($\mathcal{F}$) and the state vectors are referred to as \textit{Fock states}.
In second quantization, the Hilbert space is promoted to the Fock space via \cite{Schwartz_2013}:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F} = \oplus_n \mathcal{H}_n.
\end{equation}

Second quantization appears in quantum chemistry after projecting the Hamiltonian onto basis wavefunctions, and ensuring exchange symmetry via Slater determinants. \gus{Will, you know more about quantum chemistry than me, so please edit this as needed}.
Similarly, in quantum field theories, field operators, rather than wavefunctions, are the main objects of the theory. These field operators act on second-quantized states to create and annihilate particles in the field. 

In second quantization, creation and annihilation operators - which will collectively be refered to as \emph{ladder operators} - are used to manipulate the state of the system.
Creation operators increase the occupancy of the mode they act on, while annihilation operators decrease the occupancy.
Many observables (such as Hamiltonians) can be efficiently expressed as products and/or sums of ladder operators.  

Field operators \ws{@Gus, what is a field operator?} in quantum field theories are written in terms of ladder operators as
\begin{equation}
    \phi(x) = \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_p}}\left(a_p e^{ipx} + a_p^\dagger e^{-ipx}\right).
\end{equation}
\ws{Make sure every variable in an equation is defined either before or after. So here we need to say what $\phi$, $p$, $E_p$, $a_p$, and $x$ are.}
The Hamiltonian can then be derived from the field operators via 
\begin{equation}
    H = \int d^3x \left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\phi}}\dot{\phi} - \mathcal{L} \right)
\end{equation}

Quantum field theory Hamiltonians derived in this way are constructed in terms of products of ladder operators acting on \emph{different types} of particles.

\subsection{Ladder Operators}
\label{subsec:operators}

%\ws{@Gus, you probably have much better language to define all of this stuff. I just needed to write something down so I could reference it in the circuit construction. Don't hesitate to scrap anything in here.}
\subsubsection{Feromons and Antiferomons}

%Define action of fermionic ladder operators.

Fermions (and antifermions) obey the Pauli-exclusion principle \ws{citation} and therefore the occupation of a (anti)fermionic mode can only be occupied ($\ket{1}$) or unoccupied ($\ket{0}$).
Fermionic (and antifermionic) ladder operators only act non-trivially on the qubits encoding the mode that the ladder operator acts on and we define their action as follows.

The fermionic creation operator is given by:
\begin{equation}
    b_i^\dagger \ket{n_{i_b}} = 
    \begin{cases} 
        (-1)^{\sum_{j < i} n_{j_b}} \ket{1}  & when \ket{n_{i_b}} is \ket{0} \\
        0 & when \ket{n_{i_b}} is \ket{1}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $b_i$ denotes a fermionic ladder operator on the $i^{th}$ mode, the $^\dagger$ indicates a creation operator, and $\ket{n_{i_b}}$ is the occupation of the $i^{th}$ fermionic mode.
An antifermionic creation operator is defined as above with the symbol $d$ to denote that the operator acts on antifermions.

For a fermionic creation operator, if the mode being acted upon is unoccupied, then the creation operator "creates" a fermion in that mode and applies a phase determined by the parity of the occupation of the previous modes.
The value of $(-1)^{\sum_{j < i} n_{j_b}}$ introduces a sign flip if the parity of the $j$ modes indexed prior to $i$ is odd and does not change the sign if the parity is even. 
Therefore the ordering of the modes in the encoding has an implication on the action of the operator which must be accounted for.
If the mode is already occupied before a creation operator is applied, then the operator sets the amplitude of the quantum state to zero since a state with two particles in the same mode is not physical.
This action "destroys" that portion of the quantum state and we refer to this as "zeroing-out" the quantum state. 

The fermionic annihilation operator is given by:
\begin{equation}
    b_i \ket{n_{i_b}} = 
    \begin{cases} 
        (-1)^{\sum_{j < i} n_{j_b}} \ket{0}  & when \ket{n_{i_b}} = \ket{1} \\
        0 & when \ket{n_{i_b}} = \ket{0}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
and the antifermionic annihilation operator is likewise defined for $d$ instead of $b$.

The action of the annihilation operators is similar (and opposite) to the creation operators.
If the mode is already occupied, then the annihilation operator "annihilates" the fermion at that mode by setting the occupation to zero and applies a phase based on the parity of the occupation of the preceeding modes.
If the mode is unoccupied before the operator is applied, then the annihilation operator "zeroes-out" the amplitude.

\subsubsection{Bosos}

Similarly to fermions, the action of bosonic creation operators is to increase the occupation of the mode being acted upon by $1$.
If the occupancy is already at the (artificially restricted) maximum allowable occupancy, then the operator will zero-out the amplitude:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bosonic-creation}
    a_i^\dagger \ket{n_{i_a}} = 
    \begin{cases} 
        \sqrt{n_{i_a} + 1} \ket{n_{i_a} + 1}  & when \ket{n_{i_a}} \neq \ket{\Omega} \\
        0 & when \ket{n_{i_a}} = \ket{\Omega}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $a_i$ denotes a bosonic ladder operator on the $i^{th}$ mode, the $^\dagger$ indicates a creation operator, $\ket{n_{i_a}}$ is the occupation of the $i^{th}$ bosonic mode, and $\Omega$ is the maximum allowable bosonic occupation.
Bosonic creation operators also multiply the amplitude of the state by the square-root of the updated occupancy of the mode being acted upon.

Likewise, bosonic annihilation operators lower the occupancy of the mode being acted upon and multiply the amplitude by the square-root of the occupancy of the mode prior to being acted upon:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bosonic-annihilation}
    a_i \ket{n_{i_a}} = 
    \begin{cases} 
        \sqrt{n_{i_a}} \ket{n_{i_a} - 1}  & when \ket{n_{i_a}} \neq \ket{0} \\
        0 & when \ket{n_{i_a}} = \ket{0}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Similarly, if the occupancy of the state is zero before the operator is applied, then the amplitude is zeroed-out.

\subsection{Commutation Rules, Normal and Canonical Ordering}
\label{subsec:commutation}
It is important to mention the commutation relations between the different types of ladder operators. They are given as:

\begin{align*}
    &\{b_i, b_j^\dagger\} = \{d_i, d_j^\dagger\} = [a_i, a_j^\dagger] = \delta_{ij}\\
    & [b_i, b_j] = [b_i^\dagger, b_j^\dagger] = 0 \\
    & [d_i, d_j] = [d_i^\dagger, d_j^\dagger] = 0 \\
    & [a_i, a_j] = [a_i^\dagger, a_j^\dagger] = 0 \\
    & \{b_i, d_j\} = \{b_i^\dagger, d_j\} = \{b_i, d_j^\dagger\} = \{b_i^\dagger, d_j^\dagger\} = 0\\
    & [f(a_i), f(b_i, d_j)] = 0
\end{align*}

LOBE requires each product of ladder operators to be \emph{canonically ordered}. Canonical ordering in quantum field theory is an adaptation of normal ordering. Given a product of ladder operators, the normal ordered version of the operator is that in which all creation operators are to the left of annihilation operators.
For example, the normal-ordered version of the operator $a_3 b_4^\dagger$ is $b_4^\dagger a_3$. We define a canonically ordered operator as an operator which is normal ordered among the individual particle types, but not necessarily overall. An example of this is $a_1^\dagger b_2 b_1^\dagger$ which canonically-ordered is $b_1^\dagger b_2 a_1^\dagger$.

When canonically (or normal) ordering a product of ladder operators, one cannot just push all creation operators to the left and annihilation operators to the right, as this will change the nature of the operator in general. When ordering a product, the commutation rules must be taken into account to ensure the operator after normal ordering is the same operator.
For example, given $b_2 b_1 b_1^\dagger$, the normal ordered version of this operator is $b_2 \left(\mathds{1} - b_1^\dagger b_1 \right) = b_2 + b_1^\dagger b_1 b_2$.


\subsection{Observables}
\label{subsec:observables}

\subsubsection{Products of Ladder Operators (Terms)}

We define a \textit{term} ($T$) as a product of ladder operators that can act on fermionic, antifermionic, and bosonic modes:
\begin{equation}
    T = \prod_{m=0}^{M-1} c_m
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the number of ladder operators in the term and $c_m \in \{b_i, b_i^\dagger, d_i, d_i^\dagger, a_i, a_i^\dagger\}$.

The ladder operators ($c_m$) can be reordered arbitrarily with the introduction of additional terms due to the commutation rules described in \ref{subsec:commutation}.
In this work, we will have a preference for \textit{normal ordering} \gus{\textit{canonically ordering}} the operators to obey the following structure:
\begin{equation}
    T = \Big( \prod_i (b_i^\dagger)^{\delta_{b_i}^{\dagger}} (B_i)^{\delta_{B_i}} (b_i)^{\delta_{b_i}} \Big) \Big( \prod_i (d_i^\dagger)^{\delta_{d_i}^{\dagger}} (D_i)^{\delta_{D_i}} (d_i)^{\delta_{d_i}} \Big)   \Big( \prod_i (a_i^\dagger)^R(a_i)^S \Big) 
\end{equation}
\gus{Can we order this as fermions, antifermions, bosons, rather than the other way around? That is the style we have been using (they commute so it's technically the same).}
where $\delta$ takes the value $0$ or $1$ to denote if the operator is active in the term and the values $P$, $R$, and $S$ are integers $\in [0, \Omega]$ and denote the exponent of the bosonic ladder operators acting on that particular bosonic mode.
The operators $A_i$, $D_i$, and $B_i$ denote occupation operators acting on the $i^{th}$ bosonic, antifermionic, and fermionic modes respectively.

\ws{Describe number/occupation operators acting on fermions/antifermions and bosons and rewrite previous equation for $T$ including these operators.}

\subsubsection{Linear Combinations of Terms}

We can write Hamiltonians (or observables) in the form of linear combinations of terms:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lclo}
    H = \sum_{l=0}^{L-1} \alpha_l T_l
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the total number of terms and $\alpha_l$ is a real-valued coefficient associated with the term $T_l$.


\subsection{Encoding}
\label{subsec:encoding}
In order to map information about the multiparticle system to Fock states (and thus qubit states), an encoding must be decided. Due to the different statistics obeyed by fermions and bosons, these encodings will be different for these different types of particles. 

The fermionic encoding used is the Jordan-Wigner encoding \cite{jordan-wigner}. The map between a Fock state to a qubit state is given as 
\begin{equation}
    \ket{n_I, \dots, n_1, n_0} \rightarrow \ket{q_I, \dots, q_1, q_0}
\end{equation}
where $n_i = q_i \in [0, 1]$ depending on if mode $i$ is occupied or not. Thus, mapping a state to a qubit register corresponds to intializing qubits in the $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ state for each wire in the register. 

Alternatively, for bosons, the encoding is slightly more complicated due to the absence of the Pauli exclusion principle. For bosons, we map a Fock state to a qubit register with $n_{\text{qubits}} = I \lceil \log_2{\Omega}\rceil$.
This is because for each mode $\lambda_i \in [0, I]$, we must encode the corresponding occupancy of bosons in this mode in binary. 

Thus, for a general Fock state with fermions, antifermions, and bosons, the total number of qubits needed to map this state to a qubit register is $I_{\text{fermi}} + I_{\text{antifermi}} + I_{\text{bose}} \lceil \log_2{\Omega}\rceil$.
Throughout this work, we assume that the mode cutoffs are the same for each type of particle $I_{\text{fermi}} + I_{\text{antifermi}} + I_{\text{bose}} \equiv I$.

%Here we'll discuss how we encode the physical states we are interested in terms of qubits/registers.

\ws{Question: do we want to also cost-out the unary encoding or just the "compact" encoding that we've been primarily working with?}
