\section{Pauli Expansion of Fermionic and Bosonic Ladder Operators}
\label{sec:SB}

In this Section, we review the two different operator transformations that are used in this work to express the ladder operators in the Pauli basis.

\subsection{Jordan-Wigner Transformation}

\subsection{Standard Binary}

In this work, the registers encoding the occupation of the bosonic modes store the value of the occupation in binary notation.
The Standard Binary encoding \cite{standard-binary} provides a method for expanding the bosonic ladder operators in the Pauli basis when this binary encoding is used.

The expansion in the Pauli basis begins by noting the following definitions of the bosonic creation and annihilation operators:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:sb-expansion}
    a^\dagger &= \sum_{s = 0}^{\Omega - 1}\sqrt{s + 1}|s + 1\rangle \langle s| = \ket{1}\bra{0} + \sqrt{2}\ket{2}\bra{1} + \dots\\
    a &= \sum_{s = 0}^{\Omega - 1}\sqrt{s + 1}|s\rangle \langle s + 1| = \ket{0}\bra{1} + \sqrt{2}\ket{1}\bra{2} + \dots\\
\end{align}

From here, each state in the expansion of $a$ and $a^\dagger$ is converted into binary, e.g. $|3\rangle = |0\hdots011\rangle$, where the preceeding (most-significant) qubits are zeros and the total length of the register is given by $\lceil \log_2 (\Omega+1) \rceil$.

Now, each outer product in Eq. \ref{eq:sb-expansion} can be expanded by computing the outer product of the individual qubit values tensored together.
For example, with $\Omega = 3$ the outer product of $\ket{2}$ and $\ket{3}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \ket{2}\bra{3} = \ket{10}\bra{11} = \ket{1}\bra{1} \otimes \ket{0}\bra{1}.
\end{equation}

Each single-qubit outer product can be mapped onto the Pauli basis using the following relations:
\begin{align}
    \ket{0}\bra{0} &= \frac12 \left(I + Z \right)\\
    \ket{0}\bra{1} &= \frac12 \left(X + iY \right)\\
    \ket{1}\bra{0} &= \frac12 \left(X - iY \right)\\
    \ket{1}\bra{1} &= \frac12 \left(I - Z \right)\\ 
\end{align}

Finally, these single-qubit outer products can be tensored together to give the expansion of the multi-qubit outer products, thereby representing the ladder operators as a linear combination of Pauli operators.

An explicit example with $\Omega = 3$ is shown below: 
\begin{align}
    a_0^\dagger = &0.683IX -0.183 ZX - 0.683\mathrm{i} IY \\
                + &0.183\mathrm{i} ZY +0.354 XX - 0.354\mathrm{i} YX \\
                + &0.354\mathrm{i} XY + 0.354 YY
\end{align}
