\textbf{Future Directions}

This block-encoding creates an extension of the block-encodings known as LCU (Linear Combination of Unitaries).
It would be interesting to try to do a side-by-side cost analysis for a traditional LCU block-encoding using standard transformations to map ladder operators to Paulis vs a LOBE block-encoding.

Separately, an alternative encoding scheme (which we refer to as "unary encoding") creates a "one-hot" encoding for the occupation of the bosonic modes.
This encoding using $\Lambda (\Omega + 1)$ qubits to encode the bosonic system.
It would be interesting to also compile the oracles for this encoding and cost it out and compare with the "compact" encoding used in this work.
